            <p>A console application facilitates the reading and writing of characters from a console - either individually or as an entire line. It is the simplest form of a C# program and is typically invoked from the Windows command prompt.The Windows Console is available from the Start Button on the Taskbar; it is called 'Command Prompt' or 'MSDOS Prompt' depending on the OS; the almost undecipherable icon actually contains the letters of "MSDOS". Click on the menu, and a Console window will appear.You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console. To open the browser console, right-click on the page and select Inspect, and then click Console.</p>
